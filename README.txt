Add-ons and plugins installed on the Wii U (on Aroma):

1. Inkay - Enables the use of the Pretendo Network on your Wii U System
2. envSwap - Allows swapping between the Aroma and Tiramisu environments (since some apps are only supported by Tiramisu and not Aroma)
3. SwipSwapMe - Allows you to swap the TV and Gamepad screen (not originally supported on the Wii U). Used for the presentation aspect of the project

5. SDCafiine - Allows modding of games on the console by replacing files as needed.
6. Screenshot WUPS - Allows for the screenshot functionality to be added in to the console (The Wii U does NOT have any inbuit Screenshotting functionality)
7. NANDDumper - Dumps a copy of the unmodded Wii U's NAND onto the SD Card to allow for reformatting in the future (in case of errors and bricking)
8. Homebrew App Store - Allows loading of homebrew applications directly to the console without the need to externally download them.
